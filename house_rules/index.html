    <h1 id="house-rules">House Rules</h1>
<h1 id="a-pbta-amuse-bouche">A PbtA amuse-bouche</h1>
<p>In-game, most of the time we play w/OSE rules and procedures</p>
<p>But there are also some times and places we use PbtA die rolls to:
- resolve game mechanics
- but also to allow players authorship</p>
<h2 id="some-ideas-for-pbta-procedures">Some ideas for PbtA procedures</h2>
<ul>
<li>roll to connect w/another PC<ul>
<li>success means a bond that can be spent for advantage</li>
<li>failure means you fail to connect, in an interesting way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>roll to explore/do stuff in downtime location/do downtime activities (advance, e.g.)<ul>
<li>successes mean you get what you want</li>
<li>9 and lower mean interesting complications that you get to co-author</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>roll to return to the surface if you're down below at session end<ul>
<li>7-9 means an encounter</li>
<li>6- means you fail to return to the surface</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pbta-hexcrawling">PbtA hexcrawling</h2>
<ul>
<li>fast v. slow travel<ul>
<li>hidden things can (only) be found on a roll of 10-12</li>
<li>slow travel: 2d6+some stat mod, one roll per hex (or whatever)</li>
<li>fast travel: straight 2d6, so lower possibility of finding hidden things</li>
<li>under the hood, 9- rolls may require rolls on encounter tables, etc</li>
<li>if you've traveled a certain way before, chance of encounter drops (encounters on 6- rather than 9-)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dungeon-traversal">Dungeon traversal</h2>
<ul>
<li>dungeon traversal gets easier with a map</li>
<li>7-9 causes encounter, but you also get 1 hold<ul>
<li>can spend hold to ask question from DW's Discern Realities list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10+ is a successful traversal</li>
<li>6- means that traversal fails and you get lost, but you also get 1 hold<ul>
<li>if you're attempting to return to the surface, your PC doesn't make it to the surface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>maps confer:<ul>
<li>+mod to traversal roll</li>
<li>but nat 2-3 on traversal roll w/map means damage to map</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can use labyrinth move if needed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<ul>
<li>in immediate area, everyone has some familiarity with imperial common</li>
<li>may use the language tick system from Spider Queen for more abstruse languages</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="osr-house-rules">OSR house rules</h1>
<h2 id="roll-under-ability-score-checks">Roll under ability score checks</h2>
<p>Ain't gonna use 'em, except maybe in case of laziness. </p>
<h2 id="encumbrance">Encumbrance</h2>
<p>We're going to use the <em>Worlds without Number</em> Encumbrance system.</p>
<h2 id="shock">Shock</h2>
<p>No one likes a combat where players and monsters are just whiffing for 20 minutes (especially not me). Some classes might be eligible for weapons with Shock (from <em>Worlds without Number</em>), to speed things up. But be warned, monsters might be able to deal Shock damage as well. </p>
<h1 id="character-options">Character Options</h1>
<h2 id="thief">Thief</h2>
<p>There are two options if you want to play a thief/specialist: the simple version or the slightly more complicated version.</p>
<h3 id="option-1-thieving-for-the-simple">Option 1: Thieving for the simple</h3>
<p>Thieves don't have to keep track of all of these percentile skills in OSE RAW. You just roll a d6 if you want to do something thiefy and it's plausible, you just roll a d6. If you roll high enough, you succeed; "high enough" can be decided by GM fiat, but a base class skill chance by level might look like this: 
Level : Class skill chance
1 : 1 in 6
2 : 2 in 6
3 : 2 in 6
4 : 3 in 6
5 : 3 in 6
6 : 4 in 6
7 : 4 in 6
8 : 5 in 6
9 : 5 in 6
10 : 6 in 6 (roll 2d6; failure only happens if both are 1)</p>
<h3 id="option-2-the-lotfp-specialist">Option 2: The LotFP Specialist</h3>
<p>If you're fine with a bit more complexity and/or want to customize, the <em>Lamentations of the Flame Princess Specialist</em> has a nice skill system, including thiefy stuff as well as other things (Architecture, Bushcraft, Languages, Tinker, etc.). Only tweak is that Sneak Attack as written is pretty OP, so points in Sneak Attack will be capped by level: max 2 points at Level 1, 3 points at Level 5, etc. </p>
<h2 id="wizards">Wizards</h2>
<p>We're going to use the version of GLoG wizards in Skerples' v2 of the GLoG (https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html). Almost everything will be the same as in Skerples' presentation; I have thoughts about where many of the wizard schools will fit in our setting, but let me know if you want to take one of the very weird schools. </p>
<h1 id="death-and-dying">Death and Dying</h1>
<p>(from Gavin Norman on some random reddit thread)
Dying: Upon reaching 0 hit points, your character is unconscious and bleeding out. Roll on the following chart each round, until an ally heals you (either with magic, herbs, or binding wounds) or you die. If you are healed, you come around with 1 hit point (or more, if magic was used) and suffer a -3 penalty to attacks until you get a day's rest.</p>
<ol>
<li>You die.</li>
<li>A random ability score is permanently reduced by 1.</li>
<li>Maximum hit points permanently reduced by 1.</li>
<li>If healed, you require 1d6+1 days of rest to recover.</li>
<li>Even if healed, you remain unconscious for 1d6 hours.</li>
<li>You come around with 1 hit point.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="dicing-with-death">Dicing with Death</h1>
<p>If your character dies and the rest of the party is of a higher level than you, you <em>may</em> opt to play the "playing dice with Death" minigame. (cf. Knock 2, p. 19 for rules) For now, the XP multiplier is 150, though we'll probably bump it up to 200 at some point here. </p>
